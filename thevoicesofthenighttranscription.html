She thinks it necessary to make this statement, lest, after having heard her story, you should, however polite you might be about it, in your heart of hearts suspect her capable not only of allowing her angry passions to rise, but of permitting them to boil over &ldquo;in </span><span class="c1">tempestuous</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;fury wild and unrestrained.&rdquo; If it were an </span><span class="c1">orthodox</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;remark, she would also add, from like motives of self-defense, that she is not in the habit of swearing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Are you accustomed, O tender-hearted reader, to spend your nights as a habit, with your eyes open or shut? On the answer to this question depends her sole hope of appreciation and sympathy. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She begs you will understand that she does not mean you, the </span><span class="c1">be-ribboned and be-spangled and be-rouged </span><span class="c1">frequenter of the ball and </span><span class="c1">soir&eacute;e</span><span class="c1">, with your faint, floating perfumes, flutter of fans, and sweep of many-hued drapery; your well-taught drooping lashes, or wide girl&rsquo;s eyes, untamed and wondering, your flushing color, and your pulse up to a hundred. You are very pretty for your pains - as she hopes you know, to take the comfort of God&rsquo;s great gift as women can; as true and royal women can - oh, to be sure, you are very pretty! She has not the heart to scold you, though you are dancing and singing and flirting away your golden nights, your restful, young nights, that never come but once - though you are dancing and singing and flirting yourselves merrily into your grave. She would like to put in a plea before the eloquence of which </span><span class="c1">Cicero and Demosthenes, Beecher and Sumner</span><span class="c0">, should pale like wax-lights before the sun, for the new fashion said to be obtaining in New York, that the soir&eacute;e shall give place to the matinee, at which the guests shall assemble at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and are expected to go home at seven or eight. That would be not only civilized; it would be millennial.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But Keturah is perfectly aware that you will do as you will. If the excitement of the &ldquo;wee </span><span class="c1">sma&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;hours </span><span class="c1">ayont</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the </span><span class="c1">twal</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; prove preferable to a quiet evening at home, and a good, Christian, healthy sleep after it, why the &ldquo;sma&rsquo; hours&rdquo; it will be. If you will do it, it is &ldquo;none of her funerals,&rdquo; as the small boy remarked. Only she particularly requests you not to insult her by offering her your sympathy. Wait till you know what forty-eight mortal, wide-awake, staring, whirring, unutterable hours mean.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Listen to her mournful tale; and, while you listen, let your head become fountains of water, and your eyes rivers of tears for her, and for all who are doomed to reside in her immediate vicinity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tired nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer,&rdquo; as the newspapers in a sudden and severe poetical attack remarked of </span><span class="c1">Jeff Davis</span><span class="c1">, &ldquo;refuses to bless&rdquo; Keturah, except as her own sweet will inclines her. They have a continuous lover&rsquo;s quarrel, exceedingly bitter while it rages, exceedingly sweet when it is made up. Keturah attends a perfectly grave and unimpeachable lecture - the Restorer pouts and goes off in a huff for twenty-four hours. Keturah undertakes at seven o&rsquo;clock a concert - announced as </span><span class="c1">Mendelssohn Quintette, proving to be Gilmore&rsquo;s Brassiest</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- and nothing hears she of My Lady till two o&rsquo;clock A.M. Keturah spends an hour at a prayer-meeting, on a pine bench that may have heard of cushions, but certainly has never seen one face to face; and comes home at eight o&rsquo;clock to the pleasing discovering that the fair enslaver has taken some doctrinal offense, and vanished utterly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Though lost to sight she&rsquo;s still to memory dear, and Keturah </span><span class="c1">penitently </span><span class="c1">betakes herself to the seeking of her in those ingenious ways which she has learned at the school of a melancholy experience. A table and kerosene lamp are brought into </span><span class="c1">requisition</span><span class="c1">, also a book. If it isn&rsquo;t the Dictionary, it is </span><span class="c1">Cruden&rsquo;s Concordance</span><span class="c1">. If these prove too exciting, it is </span><span class="c1">Edwards on the Will.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Light reading is strictly forbidden. Congressional Reports are sometimes </span><span class="c1">efficacious</span><span class="c1">, as well as</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Martin F. Tupper</span><span class="c1">, and somebody&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sphere of Woman.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is one single possibility out of ten that this treatment will produce drowsiness. There are nine probabilities to the contrary. The possibility is worth trying for, and trying hard for: but if it results into the sudden flight of </span><span class="c1">President Edwards</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;across the room, a severe banging of the </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sphere of Woman&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;against the wall, and the total disappearance of </span><span class="c1">Cruden&rsquo;s Concordance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;beneath the bed, Keturah is not in the least surprised. It is although too familiar a result to elicit remark. It simply occasions a fresh growth to a horrible resolution that she has been slowly forming for years.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some day </span><span class="c1 c5">she</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will write a book. The publishers shall nap over it, and accept it with pleasure. The drowsy printers shall set up its type with their usual unerring exactness. The proofreaders shall correct it in their dreams. Customers in the book-stores shall nod at the sight of its binding. Its readers shall dose at the first page. Sleepless old age, sharp and unrelieved pain, youth sorrowful before the time, shall seek it out, shall flock unto the counter of its fortunate publishers (she has three firms in her mind&rsquo;s eye; one in Boston, one in New York, and one in Philadelphia; but who the happy men are to be is not yet definitely decided), who shall waste their inheritance in distributing it throughout the length and breadth of a grateful continent. Physicians from every where under the sun, who have proved the fickleness of </span><span class="c1">hyoscyamus, of hops, of Dover&rsquo;s powders, of opium, of morphine, of laudanum, of hidden virtues of herbs in the field, and minerals from the rock, and gases from the air;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who know the secrets of all the pitying earth, and, behold, it is vanity of vanities, shall line their hospitals, cram their offices, stuff their bottles, with the new universal </span><span class="c1">panacea</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and blessing to suffering humanity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And Keturah </span><span class="c1 c5">can</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;keep a resolution.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her literary occupation disposed of, in the summary manner referred to, she runs through the roll of her reserve force, and their name is </span><span class="c1">Legion</span><span class="c1">. She composes herself, in an attitude of rest, with a handkerchief tied over her eyes to keep them shut, blows her lamp out instead of screwing it out, strangles a while in the gas, and begins to repeat her alphabet, which, owning to like stern necessity, she has fortunately never forgotten. She says it forward; she says it backward; she begins at the middle and goes up; she begins at the middle and goes down; she rattles it through in French, she groans it through German, she falters it through Greek. She attempts the numeration table, flounders somewhere in the quadrillions, and forgets where she left off. She watched an interminable flock of sheep jump over a wall till her head spins. There always seem to be so many more where the last one came from. She listens to oar-beats, and drum-beats, and heart-beats. She improvises </span><span class="c1">sonatas and gallopades, oratorios and mazourkas</span><span class="c0">. She perpetrates the title and first line of an epic poem, goes through the alphabet for a rhyme, and none appearing, she repeats the first line by way of encouragement. But all in vain. She is as likely to fly as to sleep.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a silence that speaks unutterable things she rises solemnly, and seeks the pantry in darkness that may be felt. At the bottom of the stairs she steps with her whole weight flat upon something that squirms, and is warm, and turns over, and utters a cry that makes the night hideous. Oh, nothing but the cat, that is all! The pantry proved to be well stocked with bread, but not another mortal thing. Now, if there is anything Keturah </span><span class="c1 c5">particularly </span><span class="c1">dislikes, it is dry bread. Accordingly, with a remark which is intended for Love&rsquo;s ear alone, she gropes her way to the cellar door, which is unexpectedly open, pitches head first into the cavity, and makes the descent of half the stairs in an easy and graceful manner, chiefly with her elbows. She reaches ground after an interval, steps splash into a pool of water, knocks over a mop, and embraces a tall cider barrel with her groping arms. After a little wandering about among ash-bins and apple-bins, reservoirs and coal-heaps, and cobwebs, she discovers the hanging-shelf which has been the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ignis fatuus </span><span class="c1">of her search. Something extremely cold crossing her shoeless feet at this crisis suggests pleasant fancies of a rat. Keturah is ashamed to confess that she has never in all the days of the years of her pilgrimage set eyes upon a rat. Depending solely upon her imagination, her conception of that animal is a cross between an alligator and a jaguar. She stands her ground manfully, however, and is happy to state that she did </span><span class="c1 c5">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;faint.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the agitation consequent upon this incident she butters her bread with the lard, and takes an enormous bite on the way up the stairs. She seeks no more refreshment that night. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One resort alone is left. With a despairing sigh she turns the great faucet of the bath-tub and holds her head under it till she is upon the verge of a watery grave. This experiment is her </span><span class="c1">forlorn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;hope. Perhaps about three or four o&rsquo;clock she falls into a series of jerky naps, and dreams that she is editor of a popular Hebrew Magazine, wandering frantically through a warehouse full of a</span><span class="c1">spirant MSS </span><span class="c0">(chiefly from the junior classes of theological seminaries) of which she can not translate a letter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of the tenth of Keturah&rsquo;s unearthly experiences - of the number of times she has been taken for a robber, and chased by the entire roused and bewildered family, with loaded guns; of the pans of milk she has upset, the </span><span class="c1">crocker</span><span class="c1">y whose hopes has untimely shattered, the skulls she has cracked against open doors, the rocking-chairs she has stumbled over and </span><span class="c1">apostrophized</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in her own meek way; of the neighbors she has frightened out of town by her </span><span class="c1">perambulations</span><span class="c1">; of the alarms of fire she has raised, pacing the wood-shed with a lantern for exercise stormy nights; of all the possible and impossible corners and crevices in which she has sought repose - she has slept on every sofa in every room in the house, and once she spent a whole night on a closet shelf; of the amiable condition of her morning, and the terror she is fast becoming to family, Church, and State, the time would fail her to tell. Were she to &ldquo;let slip the dogs of war&rdquo; and relate a </span><span class="c1">modicum</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the agonies she undergoes - how the stamping of a neighbor&#39;s horse on a barn floor will drive every solitary wink of sleep from her eyes and slumber from her eyelids; the nibbling of a mouse in some un-get-at-able place in the wall, prove torture; the rattling of a pane of glass; ticking of a clock, or pattering of rain-drops, as effective as a cannon; a guest in the &ldquo;spare room&rdquo; with a musical &ldquo;love of a baby,&rdquo; something far different from a blessing, and a tolerably windy night, one lengthened virgil long drown out - the liberal editor would cry &ldquo;Forbear!&rdquo; It becomes really an interesting science to learn how slight a thing will utterly deprive an unfortunate creature of the great necessity of life; but this article not being a scientific treatise, that must be left to the sympathizing imagination.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Keturah feels compelled, however, to relate the story of two memorable nights, of which the only wonder is that she has lived to tell the tale.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Every incident is stamped indelibly upon her brain. It is wrought in letters of fire. &ldquo;While memory holds a seat on this distracted globe,&rdquo; it shall not - can not be forgotten.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a night in June - sultry, gasping, fearful. Keturah went to her own room, as is her custom, at the </span><span class="c1">Puritanic </span><span class="c1">hour of nine. Sleep for a couple of hours being out of the question she throw wide her doors and windows, and betook herself to her writing-desk. A story for a Magazine, which it was imperative should be finished to-morrow, appealed to her already partially-stupefied brain. She forced her unwilling pen into the service, whisked the table round into the draft, and began. In about five minutes the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;sibyl </span><span class="c0">caught the inspiration of her god, and heat and sleeplessness were alike forgotten. This sounds very poetic, but it wasn&rsquo;t at all. Keturah regrets to say that she had on a very unbecoming green wrapper, and several ink-spots on her fingers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was a very thrilling and original story, and it came, as all thrilling and original stories must come, to a crisis. Seraphina found Theodore kissing the hand of Celeste in the woods. Keturah became excited. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Theodore!&rdquo; whispered the unhappy maiden to the moaning trees. &ldquo;Oh, Theodore, my --&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Whirr! buzz! swoosh! came something through the window into the lamp, and down squirming into the ink-bottle. Keturah jumped. If you have half the horror of those great June beetles that she has you will know how she jumped. She emptied the entire contents of the ink-bottle out of the window in great disgust, closed her blinds, and began again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Theodore,&rdquo; said Seraphina.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seraphina,&rdquo; said Theodore - jump the second. It was - it really was - the same identical creature, whirring round the lamp, and buzzing down into her lap. Hadn&rsquo;t he been burned in the light, drowned in the ink, speared with the pen and crushed by falling from the window? Yet there he was, or the ghost of him, fluttering his inky wings into her very eyes, and walking leisurely across the smooth, fair page that waited to be inscribed with Seraphina&rsquo;s woe. Nerved by despair, Keturah did a horrible thing. Never before or since has she been known to accomplish it. She put him down on the floor and stepped on him. She repented of the act in dust and ashes. Before she could get across the room to close the window ten more had come to his funeral. To describe the horror of the ensuing hour she had no words. She put them out of the window - they came directly back. She drowned them in the wash-bowl - they fluttered, and sputtered, and buzzed up into the air. She killed them in the corner - they came to life under her very eyes. She caught them in her handkerchief and tied up them tight - they crawled out before she could get them in. She shut the cover of the wash-stand down on them - she looked in a while after and there was not one to be seen. All ten of the great blundering creatures were knocking their brains out against the ceiling. After the endurance of terrors that came very near turning her hair gray she had pushed the last one out on the balcony, shut the window, and was gasping away in the airless room, her first momentary sense of security, when there struck upon her agonized ear a fiendish buzzing, and three of them came whirling back through a crack about as large as a knitting-needle. No </span><span class="c1 c5">mortal </span><span class="c0">beetle could have gotten through it. Keturah turned pale and let them alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The clock was striking eleven when quiet was at last restored, and the exhausted sufferer began to think of sleep. At this moment she heard a sound before which her heart sank like lead. You must know that Keturah has a very near neighbor, Miss Humdrum by name. Miss Humdrum is a - well, a very excellent and pious old lady, who keeps a one-eyed servant and three cats. And the sound which Keturah heard was Miss Humdrum&rsquo;s cats.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Keturah descended to the wood-shed, armed herself with a huge oaken log, and sallied out into the garden, with a horribl</span><span class="c1">e </span><span class="c1 c5">sang froid</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that only long familiarity with her errand could have engendered. It was Egyptian darkness; but her practiced eye discerned, or thought it discerned, a white cat upon the top of the high wooden fence. Keturah smiled a ghastly smile, and fired. Now she never yet in her life threw anything any where, under any circumstances, that did not go exactly in the opposite direction from what she wanted to have it. This occasion proved no exception. The cat jumped, and sprang over, and disappeared. The stick went exactly into the middle of the fence. Keturah can not suppose that the last trump will be capable of making a louder noise. She stood transfixed. One cry alone broke the hideous silence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; in an unmistakably Irish, half-wakened howl, from the open window of the one-eyed servant&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Only that, and nothing more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Keturah returned to her apartment, a sadder if not wiser woman. </span><span class="c0">Marius among the ruins of Carthage, Napoleon at St. Helena, M&rsquo;Clellan in Europe, have henceforth and forever her sympathy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She thinks it was </span><span class="c1 c5">precisely</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;five minutes after her return, during which the happy stillness that seemed to rest upon nature without and nature within had whispered faint promises of coming rest - that there suddenly broke upon it a hoarse, deep, unearthly breathing, So hoarse, so deep, so unearthly, and so directly underneath her window, that for about ten seconds, Keturah sat paralyzed. There was but one thing it could be. A traveling</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;menagerie</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in town had lost its Polish wolf that very day. This was the Polish wolf. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The horrible panting, like the panting of a famished creature, came nearer, grew louder, grew hoarser. The animal had found a bone in the grass, and was crunching it in his ghastly way. Then she could hear him sniffing at the door.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And Amram&rsquo;s door was on the lower story! Perhaps wolves climbed in windows!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The awful thought roused Keturah from the </span><span class="c1">stupor</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of her terror. She was no coward. She would face the fearful sight. She would call and warn him at any risk. She faltered out upon the balcony. She leaned over the railing. She gazed breathlessly down into the darkness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A cow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Another cow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Three cows.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Keturah sat down on the window-sill in the calm of despair.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was succeeded by a storm. She concludes that she was about five seconds on the passage from her room to the garden. With &ldquo;hair </span><span class="c1">flotant</span><span class="c1">, and arms disclosed,&rdquo; like harpies of</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;heraldic</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;device, she rushed up to the invaders - and stopped. Exactly what was to be done? Three great stupid, browsing, contented cows </span><span class="c1 c5">versus </span><span class="c0">one lone, lorn woman. For about one minute Katurah would not have wagered her fortune on the woman. But it is not her custom to &ldquo;say die,&rdquo; and after some reflection she ventured on a manful command:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go away! Go! go!&rdquo; The </span><span class="c1">stentorian</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;remark caused a result for which she was, to say the least, unprepared. The creatures coolly turned about and walked directly up to her. To be sure. Why not? Is it not a part of our outrageous Yankee nomenclature to teach cows to come to you when you tell them to go away? How Keturah, country-born and bred, could have even momentarily forgotten </span><span class="c1">so clear</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1">simple a principle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of philology remains a mystery to this day. A little reflection convinced her of the only logical way of ridding herself of her guests. Accordingly, she walked a little way behind them and tried again. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come here, Sir! Come, good fellow! Wh-e-e! come here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Three great wooden heads lifted themselves slowly, and three </span><span class="c1">pair</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of soft, sleepy eyes looked at her, and the beasts returned to their clover and stood stock-still.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What was to be done? You could go behind and push them. Or you could go in front and pull them by the horns.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Neither of these methods exactly striking Keturah&rsquo;s fancy, she took up a little chip and threw at them; also a piece of coal and a handful of pebbles. These gigantic efforts proving to be fruitless she sat down on the grass and looked at them. The heartless creatures resisted even that appeal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">At this crisis of her woes one of Keturah&rsquo;s many brilliant thoughts came to her relief. She hastened upon the wings of the wind to her</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;infallible</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;resort, the wood-shed, and filled her arms up to the chin with pine knots. Thus equipped she started afresh to the conflict. It is recorded that out of twenty of those sticks, thrown with savage and direful intent, only one hit. It is, however, recorded that the enemy dispersed, after being valiantly pursued around the house, out of the front gate (where one stuck, and got through with the greatest difficulty), and for a quarter of a mile down the street. In the course of the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;rout</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Keturah tripped on her dress only six times, and fell flat but four. One pleasing little incident gave delightful variety to the scene. A particularly frisky and clover-loving white cow, whose heart yearned after </span><span class="c1">the apples of Sodom</span><span class="c1">, turned about in the road without any warning whatever and showed fight. Keturah adopted a sudden resolution to return home &ldquo;across lots,&rdquo; and climbed the nearest stone-wall with considerable </span><span class="c1 c5">empressement</span><span class="c1">. Exactly half-way over she was surprised to find herself gasping among the low-hanging </span><span class="c1">boughs</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of a butternut-tree, where she hung like </span><span class="c1">Absalom of old, between heaven and earth.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;She would like to state in this connection that she always had too much vanity to wear a waterfall; so she still retains a portion of her original hair.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, she returned victorious over the silent dew-laden fields and down into the garden path, where she paced for two hours back and forth among the aromatic perfumes of the great yellow June lilies. There might have been a bit of poetry in it under other circumstances, but Keturah was not poetically inclined on that occasion. The events of the night had so roused her soul within her that exercise unto exhaustion was her sole remaining hope of sleep.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At about two o&rsquo;clock she crawled faintly up stairs again, and had just fallen asleep with her head on the window-sill, when a wandering dog had come directly under the window, and sit there and bark for half an hour at a rake-handle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Keturah made no other effort to fight her destiny. Determined to meet it heroically, she put a chair precisely into the middle of the room, and sat up straight in it, till she heard the birds sing. Somewhere about that epoch she fell into a doze with one eye open, when a terrific </span><span class="c1">peal</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of thunder started at her feet. It was Patsy knocking at the door to announce that her breakfast was cold.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the ghastly condition of the following day the story was finished and sent off. It was on this occasion that the patient and long-enduring Editor ventured mildly to suggest, that when, by a thrilling and horrible mischance, Seraphina&rsquo;s lovely hand came between a log of wood and a full force of Theodore&rsquo;s hatchet the result </span><span class="c1 c5">might</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have been more disastrous than the loss of a finger-nail. Alas! even his editorial omniscience did not know - how could it? - the story of that night. Keturah forgave him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It is perhaps worthy of mention that Miss Humdrum appeared promptly at eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning, with her handkerchief </span><span class="c1">at her</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;eyes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My Star-spangled Banner, my nearest and dearest, has met with her decease, Ketury.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed! How very sad!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, She has met with her decease. Under </span><span class="c1 c5">very </span><span class="c0">peculiar circumstances, Ketury.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Keturah, hunting for her own handkerchief; finding three in her pocket, she brought them all into requisition.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And I feel it my duty to inquire,&rdquo; says Miss Humdrum, &ldquo;whether it may happen that </span><span class="c1 c5">you </span><span class="c0">know any thing about the event, Ketury.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Keturah, weeping, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know she was dead even! Dear Miss Humdrum, you are indeed afflicted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I feel compelled to say,&rdquo; pursued Miss Humdrum eying this wretched hypocrite severely, &ldquo;that my girl Jeminy </span><span class="c1 c5">did</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;hear somebody fire a gun or a cannon or something, out in your garden last night, and she </span><span class="c1">scar&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;out of her wits, and my poor cat found cold under the hogshead this morning, Ketury.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Miss Humdrum,&rdquo; said Keturah, &ldquo;I can not in justice to myself answer such insinuations, further than to say that Amram </span><span class="c1 c5">never</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;allows the gun to go out of his own room. The cannon we keep in the cellar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Miss Humdrum, with horrible suspicion in her eyes. &ldquo;Well, I hope you haven&rsquo;t it on your conscience, I&rsquo;m sure. </span><span class="c1 c5">Good</span><span class="c0">-morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It had been the ambition of Keturah&rsquo;s life to see a burglar. The second of the memorable nights referred to crowned this ambition by not only one burglar but two. She it was who discovered them, she who frightened them away, and nobody but she ever saw them. She confessed to a natural and unconquerable pride in them. It came about on this wise:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was one of Keturah&rsquo;s wide-awake nights, and she had been wandering off into the fields at the foot of the garden, where it was safe and still. There is, by-the-way, a peculiar awe in the utter hush of the earliest morning hours, of which no one can know who has not familiarized himself with it in all its moods. A solitary walk in a solitary place, which the great world sleeping about you, and the great skies throbbing above you, and the long unrest of the panting summer night, fading into the cool of dews, and pure gray dawns, has in it something of what Mr. Robertson calls &ldquo;God&rsquo;s silence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Once, on one of these lonely rambles, Keturah found away in the fields, under the shadow of an old stone-wall, a baby&rsquo;s grave. It had no head-stone to tell its story, and the weeds and brambles of many years have overgrown it. Keturah is not of a romantic disposition, especially on her midnight tramps, but she sat down by the little nameless thing, and looked from it to the arch of eternal stars that summer and winter, seed-time and harvest, kept steadfast watch over it, and was very still. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the standing grievances of her life that Amram, while never taking the trouble to go and look, insists upon it </span><span class="c1">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;nothing but somebody&rsquo;s pet dog. She knows better.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">On this particular night, Keturah, </span><span class="c1">in coming</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;up from the garden to return to the house, had a dim impression that something crossed the walk in front of her, and disappeared among the rustling trees. The impression was sufficiently strong to keep her sitting up for half an hour at her window, under the feeling that an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure. She has indeed been asked why she did not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">reconnoitre</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the rustling trees upon the spot. She considers that would have been an exceedingly poor stroke of policy, and of an impolitic thing Keturah is not </span><span class="c1">capable</span><span class="c0">. She sees far and plans deep. Supposing she had gone and been shot through the head, where would have been the fun of her burglars? To yield a life-long aspiration at the very moment that is within grasp was too much to ask, even of Keturah.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Words can not describe the sensations of the moment, when that half-hour was rewarded by the sight of two stealthy, cat-like figures, creeping out from among the trees. A tall man and a little man, and both with very </span><span class="c1">unbanditti-like </span><span class="c0">straw-hats on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now if Keturah has a horror in this world, it is that delicate play of the emotions commonly known as &ldquo;women&rsquo;s nonsense.&rdquo; And therefore did she sit still for three mortal minutes, with her burglars making tracks for the kitchen window under her very eyes, in order to prove to herself and an </span><span class="c1">incredulous</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;public, beyond all shadow of doubt or suspicion, that they were robbers and not dreams; actual flesh and blood, not nightmares; unmistakable hats and coats, in a place where hats and coats ought not to be, not clothes-lines and pumps. She tried hard to make Amram and the </span><span class="c1">Paterfamilias</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;out of them. Who knew but they also, by some unheard-of revolution in all the laws of nature, were on an exploring expedition after truant sleep? She struggled manfully after the conviction that they were innocent and unimpeachable neighbors, cutting the short way home across the fields from some remarkably late prayer-meeting. She agonized after the belief that they were two of Patsy&rsquo;s sweet-hearts, come for the commendable purpose of serenading her. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In fact, they were almost in the house before this remarkable female was prepared to trust the evidence of her own senses.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But when suspense gloomed into certainty, Keturah is happy to say that she was grandly equal to the occasion. She slammed open her blinds with an emphasis, and lightened her lamp with a burnt match.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The men jumped, and dodged, and ran, and hid behind the trees, in the approved manner of burglars, who flee when no woman pursueth; and Keturah, being of far too generous a disposition to enjoy the pleasure of their capture unshared, lost no time in hammering at Amram&rsquo;s door.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Amram!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No answer</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c5">Am</span><span class="c0">ram!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Silence. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Am-</span><span class="c1 c5 c7">ram!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh! Ugh! Who-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Silence again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Amram, wake up! Come out here - quick!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;O-o-oh yes. Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Keturah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Keturah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Amram, be quick, or we shall all have our throats cut! There are some men in the garden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c5">Men </span><span class="c0">in the garden!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Men?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the </span><span class="c7 c1 c5">garden!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Garden?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Keturah can bear a great deal, but there comes a limit even to her proverbial patience. She burst open the door without ceremony, and is under the impression that Amram received a shaking such as even his tender youth was a stranger to. It </span><span class="c1">effectually</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;woke him up to consciousness, as well as to the gasping and particularly senseless remark, &ldquo;What on earth was she wringing his neck for?&rdquo; As if he mightn&rsquo;t have known! She has the satisfaction of remembering that he was asked in return &ldquo;Did he expect a solitary unprotected female to keep all his murderers away from him, as well as those wolves she drove off the other night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, there was no time to be wasted in tender words, and before a woman could have winked Amram made his appearance dressed and armed and sarcastically incredulous. Keturah grasped the pistol, and followed him at a respectful distance. Stay in the house and hold the light? Catch her! She would take the light with her, and the house too, if necessary, but she would be in at the death.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She wishes Mr. Darley were on hand, to immortalize the picture they made, scouring the premises after those exceedingly disobliging burglars - especially Keturah, in the green wrapper, with her hair rolled all up in a huge knob on top of her head, to keep it out of the way, and her pistol held out at arm&rsquo;s-length, pointed, faltering, directly at the stars. She will inform the reader confidentially - tell it not in Gath - of a humiliating discovery she made exactly four weeks afterward, and which she has never before imparted to a human creature - it wasn&rsquo;t loaded.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well; they peered behind every door, they glared into every shadow, they squeezed into every crack, they dashed into every corner, they listened </span><span class="c1">at every</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cranny and crevice, step and turn. But not a burglar! Of course not. A regiment might have run away while Amram was waking up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Keturah thinks it will hardly be credited that this hopeful person dared to suggest and dares to maintain that it was </span><span class="c1 c5">cats!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The insult is rendered more glaring by the fact that Amram is nothing but a Sophomore in Yale College.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But she must draw the story of her afflictions to a close. And lest her &ldquo;solid&rdquo; reader&rsquo;s eyes reject the rambling recital as utterly </span><span class="c1">unworthy the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;honor of their notice, she is tempted to whittle it down to a moral before saying farewell. For you must know that Keturah has learned several things from her mournful experience.</span></p><ol class="c6 lst-kix_ff6n89rhmv6a-0 start" start="1"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">That every individual of her acquaintance, male and female, aged and youthful, orthodox and heretical, who sleeps regularly nine hours out of the twenty-four, has his or her own</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;especial</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;specimen recipe of a &ldquo;perfectly harmless </span><span class="c1">anodyne</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; to offer, with advice thrown in.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">That nothing ever yet put her to sleep but a merciful Providence.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">A great respect for </span><span class="c1">Job</span><span class="c0">.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">That the notion commonly and conscientiously received by very excellent people, that wakeful nights can and should be spent in prayer, religious meditation, and general spiritual growth, is all they know about it. Hours of the extremest bodily and mental exhaustion, when every nerve is quivering as if laid bare, and the surface of the brain burning and whirling to agony, with the reins of control let loose on every evil and every senseless thought, are not the times most likely to be chosen for the purest communion with God. To be sure, </span><span class="c1">King David</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;remembered Him upon his bed, and meditated upon Him into the night-watches.&rdquo; Keturah does not undertake to contradict Scripture, but she has come to the conclusion that David was either a </span><span class="c1 c5">very </span><span class="c0">good man, or he didn&rsquo;t lie awake very often.</span></li></ol><p class="c9"><span class="c1">But, over and above all, </span><span class="c1 c5">haec fabula docet</span><span class="c0">:</span></p><ol class="c6 lst-kix_ff6n89rhmv6a-0" start="5"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">That people who can sleep when they want to should keep Thanksgiving every day in the year.</span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
