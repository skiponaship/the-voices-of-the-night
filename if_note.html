<p>Coming into this project, both Skip and I were drawn to making interactive fiction; We had both found interactive fiction for our Short Assignment 3 and came to appreciate them as a compelling form of storytelling. During our search for potential contenders for our final project, we searched for stories specifically to create interactive fiction. As I noted in my Short Assignment 3, I believed interactive fiction worked best with stories that had good re-readability or re-playability, which were stories with compelling enough plots to draw readers or players back in. We initially thought stories with horror or mystery themes could work best, but our final choice, &ldquo;The Voices in the Night&rdquo; by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, falls into neither category. However, &ldquo;The Voices in the Night&rdquo; tells a story of two surreal nights with the main character, Keturah, making unexpected decisions. For example, Keturah&rsquo;s choice to kill the first beetle was a surprising decision even for her as <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_harpers-magazine_1866-05_32_192/page/789/mode/1up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is stated</a> that &ldquo;[n]ever before or since has she been known to accomplish it.&rdquo; The whole plot of Phelps&rsquo;s work is based around a woman who experiences some of the most wildest nights of her mundane life, which we believed could be a good basis to create an interactive fiction as the players navigate these bizarre nights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking an old 19th-century short story and transforming it into a more modern interactive fiction requires a change of modes. As Linda Hutcheon defines in her excerpt &ldquo;Beginning to Theorize Adaptation&rdquo; from her book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/NE7XtwAACAAJ?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj14NWy8Pb-AhWSMVkFHXT3DOwQre8FegQIAxAW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Theory of Adaptation</a>,&rdquo; the short story would be a &ldquo;telling&rdquo; mode while the interactive fiction would be an &ldquo;interacting&rdquo; mode. As a telling mode, our experiences as readers of the original &ldquo;The Voices of the Night&rdquo; is mostly based on our imagination as we must interpret the text. On the other hand, our interactive fiction, as an &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; mode, allows us to physically enter the world of the short story and act within it. This change of mode forced me to re-evaluate different parts of the story to see how we can adapt it to offer a new perspective of the original work. As a narrative text, the original story is a static piece of work: the story cannot be changed and we know the plot will play out as we re-read. However, interactive fiction allows the players to have an influence over the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, I thought of ways to adapt a static piece of work into a more dynamic one. The most straightforward choice was creating a &ldquo;choose-your-own-adventure&rdquo; type of interactive fiction where the player could relive Keturah&rsquo;s surreal night adventures and decide which routes to take based on important plot choices. Since &ldquo;The Voices in the Night&rdquo; is a short story, there is not a great amount of content to work with. As a result, I planned on expanding the story to have two different endings. Each choice would accumulate a certain amount of points that would lead to the story&rsquo;s &ldquo;True Ending&rdquo; or an &ldquo;Alternate Ending.&rdquo; The &ldquo;True Ending&rdquo; would be achieved if the player chooses the same choices Keturah makes in the original story, while the &ldquo;Alternate Ending&rdquo; would be achieved if the player deviates from the original plot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In brainstorming for these new endings, I decided to use this interactive fiction to further highlight Phelps&rsquo;s underlying feminist message in &ldquo;The Voices in the Night.&rdquo; Around Phelps&rsquo;s time, the idea of &ldquo;True Womanhood&rdquo; was a prevalent ideology. As defined by Barbara Welter in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711179" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820-1860,&rdquo;</a> women were expected to remain pious, pure, domestic, and submissive. Welter writes, "[t]he true woman's place was unquestionably by her own fireside - as daughter, sister, but most of all as wife and mother. Therefore domesticity was among the virtues most prized&hellip;&rdquo; Domesticity, referring to the idea that women should be in charge of the home and family life, is a pressing idea in &ldquo;The Voices in the Night.&rdquo; In the beginning pages, the readers can see Keturah live her mundane and dull experiences as a wife at home, with her struggle to sleep indicating how boring and repetitive her life is. Thus, the two surreal adventures Keturah experiences juxtapose her monotonous life, offering a new thrill. This is evident near the end of the story where it is stated that &ldquo;[i]t had been the ambition of Keturah&rsquo;s life to see a burglar,&rdquo; and her dream had come true when she spotted two robbers sneaking around her house at night; she is desperately wishing for some excitement in her life. However, this fantasy is cut short when her husband, too slow and ignorant to get out of bed, allows the robbers time to escape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Mixing in these feminist themes, I planned for the &ldquo;True Ending&rdquo; to be the end where the player, after making the similar bizarre decisions Keturah makes in the original, will be empowered enough to seek a more extraordinary adventure, and goes to chase the robbers herself without her husband. If the player received the &ldquo;Alternate Ending,&rdquo; in which the player chooses different choices than Keturah, the player would not feel empowered enough to take on the robbers and must rely on her husband for safety. These two endings also drew inspiration from Frances Watkins Harper&rsquo;s short story,<a href="https://www.literaryladiesguide.com/full-texts-of-classic-works/the-two-offers-by-frances-watkins-harper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> &ldquo;The Two Offers.&rdquo;</a> &ldquo;The Two Offers&rdquo; follows a pair of cousins, Laura and Jannete, where the former enters a loveless marriage and the latter remains single. Laura ends up dying a heartbreaking death from loneliness at the end of the story, while Jannete, a single woman, is able to experience more freedom without the chains of marriage. Harper uses her short story to warn women not to rely on their marriage and instead seek to fulfill their lives in their own ways. Ultimately, the player as Keturah in our interactive fiction is offered their own two choices, like Harper&rsquo;s characters,&nbsp; one where the player is able to attain a sense of freedom and enjoyment and the other where the player remains trapped in their marriage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, due to a time constraint, I was only able to implement a small fraction of the story as a prototype. I started the interactive fiction during the beginning of the first surreal night, where the player goes to write to deal with their insomnia. This was a few pages into the story. However, I felt that the beginning parts of &ldquo;The Voices of the Night&rdquo; were insignificant to the rest of the plot, so I decided to cut this introduction out of the interactive fiction. From a creator standpoint, I wanted the players to start the interactive fiction in a more eventful way rather than having them trudge through unimportant story details where they could easily lose interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I implemented two major choices in the prototype: whether or not the player kills the first beetle on their first try, and whether or not the player kills the neighbor&rsquo;s cat. The first choice about the beetle is a mandatory decision, as the whole first night starts with this first beetle. If the player kills the beetle on their first try, they gain extra points towards their score. If not, the game enters a loop where the story doesn&rsquo;t progress until the player kills the beetle or the story forces them to. With each loop, the points the player gains decrease.</p>
<p>Once the player kills the first beetle, they then have to deal with 10 more beetles that come to bother them. The player is then presented with four different choices: throw them out of the window, drown them, kill them, or trap them. The player must cycle through all four of these choices for the story to progress. The order does not affect the outcome of the story; However, this cycle is meant to simulate the hopelessness Keturah experiences when trying to get rid of the beetles. Ultimately, the player, like Keturah, must give up and just leave them alone.</p>
<p>The last major choice I implemented into the prototype was about the neighbor&rsquo;s cat. In the original &ldquo;The Voices in the Night,&rdquo; Keturah makes a surprising decision to throw a log at her neighbor&rsquo;s cat. If the player also chooses to kill the cat, the player receives extra points and also unlocks a (theoretical) extra cutscene later in the game where the player will be interrogated by their neighbor. In this theoretical cutscene, the player can either cover up their actions (the canon choice) or admit to killing the cat. If the player leaves the cat alone, they lose out on this integral part of the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I wasn&rsquo;t able to spend more time on the game, I had some more ideas in mind about more major choices the player could make. This includes how the player decides to deal with the cows on their lawn and how they decide to deal with the bandits. The last choice leads into the player&rsquo;s ending, and whether or not the player has garnered enough points to reach the &ldquo;True Ending.&rdquo; Also due to a lack of time, I was unable to add any compelling audio or visuals to my interactive fiction. I used Twine, an engine to create interactive fiction, and was able to add transitions and timed responses; I specifically wrote these in my code in order to eventually add some sound effects (like an insect buzz when the first beetle comes in). The visual and audio components of an interactive mode are one of its major advantages, as these details can enrich the players into the story beyond what a telling mode can do. Thus, I wanted to be able to utilize them well if given the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have compiled the prototype along with Skip and I&rsquo;s project materials that can be accessed after the first playthrough of the interactive fiction. If players are interested in the original work or our interpretations, they can easily access it through our website. Having digitalized Phelps&rsquo;s work and creating an interactive fiction has given &ldquo;The Voices of the Night&rdquo; a new life; In a digital world where the Internet is easily accessible and storytelling has evolved into fun new forms like interactive fiction, republishing and adapting Phelps&rsquo;s work allows for it to thrive beyond the 19th-century.&nbsp;</p>
