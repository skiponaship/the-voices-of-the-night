  <p> Imagine beetles the size of your fist flying at you from all directions, cats dropping off fences, the night filling with whispers of Persian wolves, and strange men in black creeping through your backyard. Now, imagine that your day-to-day married life is so restrictive that these events provide a respite from the mundanity. Perhaps you now have a sense of how Keturah, the protagonist of Elizabeth Stuard Phelps Ward’s “The Voices of the Night”, felt. 

But, before we start analyzing the events of the titular night, let’s start with my search through the archives. While looking for a short story to resurrect, I narrowed my search down to works by 19th-century feminist authors. When I initially came across “The Voices of the Night,” I was confused. Instead of criticizing the role of the patriarchy in Keturah’s fate, Phelps blamed Keturah’s troubles on insomnia. However, after careful re-reading, I discovered that this story goes deeper than just insomnia. As Auyoung argues in “What We Mean by Reading,” collecting and applying background knowledge while interpreting a text is fundamental to understanding it fully (Auyoung 95). She advises that readers look for patterns between the texts of an author, so that’s what I did. After digging through the archive more, I realized that a significant portion of Phelps’s works focused on the impossibility of managing both the harsh expectations of domestic life and one's personal ambitions. With this knowledge in mind, I reread “The Voices of the Night” and considered how this theme appeared. Through this rereading, I discovered a secondary truth hidden behind the facade of insomnia; in this short story, Phelps explores the effects of patriarchal constructs on the livelihoods and autonomy of women in the 19th century. 

I first noticed the restrictions that marriage put on Keturah’s ability to entertain herself. The first paragraphs of the story emphasize the passage of time. This builds a feeling of mundanity that reflects how Keturah experiences her own life. During the day chronicled in these paragraphs, the Restorer “goes off in a huff for twenty-four hours”, Keturah listens to a concert at “seven o’clock”, is gone until “two o’clock”, spends “an hour” at Church, and finally returns home at “eight o’clock” (Phelps 1-2). It quickly becomes tedious for the reader to hear about the timetable of her day in such excruciating detail, which gives the reader a peek into how Keturah feels as she lives it every day. 
Keturah’s life as a married woman stagnates: she dreams of being a published writer but is instead confined to days of sad bread and gray baths. While describing Keturah’s nightly routine, Phelps writes, “With a despairing sigh she turns the great faucet of the bathtub and holds her head under it till she is upon the verge of a watery grave. This experiment is her forlorn hope” (Phelps 3). The use of the phrases “despairing sigh” and “forlorn hope” elicit feelings of hopelessness, which is then exacerbated by the imagery of a watery grave.  Additionally, stating that the faucet is “great” implies that Keturah is small, making her seem vulnerable and piteous. Phelps also describes Keturah’s dinners: “The pantry proved to be well stocked with bread, but not another mortal thing. Now, if there is anything Keturah particularly dislikes, it is dry bread” (Phelps, 3). Even the food she eats is plain and unsatisfying.

	Phelps’s naming decisions also reflect the exhausting nature of her relationship. In “What We Mean By Reading”, Auyoung explains that specialized background knowledge can be applied to deconstruct the meaning of stories (Auyoung 100). I do this here with Keturah’s name. Although it’s impossible to confirm Phelps’s intentions when naming the protagonist Keturah, one can speculate that her name is an allusion to the way that marriage binds her. The name Keturah originates from Abraham’s wife in the Hebrew Bible. Theologists believe her name to be associated with the Aramaic term “ketur” which means “knot”, referring to the way that Keturah’s sexual relations were restricted (or tied) to Abraham. Similarly to the biblical Keturah, the Keturah from “The Voices of the Night'' is bound to her husband. This makes it difficult for her to pursue any of her ambitions outside of marriage.

The only chances that she has to pursue these ambitions occur during horrible, borderline-supernatural events. Near the end of the second night, Keturah encounters a group of burglars in her backyard. Rather than seeing them as a threat or inconvenience, Keturah embraces the intruders as an opportunity for a novel experience. Phelps writes, “It had been the ambition of Keturah’s life to see a burglar” (Phelps 5). Her life is rather uneventful - she’s confined to the menial tasks of a housewife - so she treasures such a diversion from the mundanity of domestic life. The juxtaposition between a burglary and a chance for excitement emphasizes how terrible Keturah’s day-to-day life is and shows us how much she craves escape.
	
Keturah isn’t just trapped by marriage, she’s also trapped by 19th century social expectations for women. Phelps explores the confining nature of Victorian-era norms for married women from the opening line. Phelps writes, “Keturah wishes to state primarily that she is good natured” (Phelps 1). The fact that we learn about Keturah’s calm temperament before anything else is intentional: Phelps wants us to know that Keturah prioritizes being viewed as “good natured” over everything. Without this prelude, Keturah fears that readers will “suspect her capable not only of allowing her angry passions to rise, but of permitting them to boil over ‘in tempestuous fury wild and unrestrained’” (Phelps 1). For Keturah, being perceived as hostile is the worst outcome.
Furthering the idea that strict social norms forced married Victorian-era women to prioritize social appearances, Phelps concludes the introductory paragraph with “[Keturah] would also add, from… motives of self-defense, that she is not in the habit of swearing” (Phelps 1).  Once again, Keturah is mainly concerned with preserving her image as a docile, pure woman - in this case, one who does not swear. 
In this opening section, Phelps employs free indirect style to let Keturah’s voice come through more naturally in the writing. As H. Porter Abbott explains, this literary tool allows writers to embed the internal thoughts of their characters in narration. Here, Phelps uses free indirect style to capture Keturah’s own perceptions of what femininity should look like. Phelps describes the reader as “the be-ribboned and be-spangled and be-rouged frequenter of the ball and soirée… oh, to be sure, you are very pretty!” (Phelps 1). Although it’s the narrator who is talking, the typical objectivity of third person narration dissolves into the subjectivity of the first person and we see how much Keturah values prettiness and beauty as a form of social status. General Victorian society has ingrained the idea that beauty is directly correlated with respect into Keturah’s perception of the world, and in turn, us (the readers).

	The restrictive nature of these social norms manifests in the myth of “women’s hysteria”. Women who act outside of the status quo are at risk of being labeled hysterical, forcing women to be cautious of the claims they make - even when it puts them in danger. At first, when Keturah spots the burglars in the garden, she doubts her own perception: “They were almost in the house before this remarkable female was prepared to trust the evidence of her own senses” (Phelps 6). Given the tendency for men to write off women’s concerns as “hysterics” during this time, it’s no surprise that Keturah struggles to trust her senses. She’s unconsciously accepted the idea that she’s prone to imagining things, costing her valuable minutes and endangering her life. The exploration of internalized sexism in the form of women’s hysteria portrays the dangers of patriarchal social norms.
Keturah’s husband also buys into the idea of “women’s hysteria”, claiming that she’s imagining things. After searching through the house, he “dared to suggest and dares to maintain that [what Keturah saw in the garden] was cats!” (Phelps 6). Instead of trusting his wife and taking the burglary seriously, Amram writes her off as overdramatic and too reactive. Once again, the tendency for men to dismiss the emotions of women as hysteria prevents them from taking women’s concerns seriously.

	In a world which so tragically mirrors Phelps’s, it’s important for modern feminists to grapple with the call for domestic reform in “The Voices of the Night”. Patriarchal institutions still strip women of their personal autonomy, prevent them from realizing their ambitions, and tell them they’re hysterical. With the fall of Roe V. Wade and the subsequent criminalization of abortions across the country, bodily autonomy and agency in motherhood is under threat. Beyond the horrors of modern legislation, women remain confined to subservient positions through marriages. CNBC reporter Stacy Francis explains that “A large number of American women stay in marriages that are unhealthy and even border on dysfunctional due to financial insecurity and stress, and the ongoing gender pay gap.” Inequitable wage practices still confine modern-day women to the domestic sphere. Additionally, “women’s hysteria” still pervades interpersonal relationships. Even today, men claim that women are “overreacting” or “crazy” as a way to dismiss the problems that they bring up. Perhaps by understanding the frustrations and struggles of Victorian era women through stories like “The Voices of the Night”, we can better understand how to move forward in a world that’s scarily similar.
