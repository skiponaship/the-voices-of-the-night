<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Preface: the 19th-century American short story and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps</em></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"x;">Short stories were undeniably one of the most popular types of fiction in 19th-century America. The introduction to &ldquo;Periodical Literature in Nineteenth-century America&rdquo; n<span style="color: #333333;">otes that w</span>ith the growth of magazines and newspapers, these periodicals lent themselves as a platform for authors to efficiently publish their work and sustain their careers. With the consistent supply of short stories, they shaped much of 19th-century American literature; as the Editor&rsquo;s Study of issue 441 of <em>Harper&rsquo;s New Monthly Magazine </em>states, &ldquo;Americans have [...] brought the short story nearer perfection in the all-round [...] it was a literary form peculiarly adapted to the American temperament&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, while male writers like Edgar Allen Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne were the most popular short story writers, women of the 19th century also found their own success in short stories. As scholar Susan Coultrap-McQuin writes &ldquo;... women authors were very popular and prominent in the nineteenth century [...] Best-seller lists reveal that by the 1850s women were authors of almost half of the popular literary works.&rdquo; However, Coultrap-McQuin also notes that despite their contributions to the literary world, women were often cast aside due to misogyny and the idea that writing as a career was unacceptable for women. Much of the short stories produced by women during this time period inevitably reflected their experiences and injustices as delegates to their homes and families. Scholar Valerie Sanders notes that &ldquo;<span style="color: #1a1a1a;">Literature, above all, was a place where women could explore the intimate details of their emotions and social interactions, imagining new relationships and life choices, while also protesting against the injustices they saw around them.&rdquo;</span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"x;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a;">Such examples of these feminist works were written by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward (1844-1911), who centered topics about &ldquo;women's economic and emotional independence [...] the 'true woman' stereotype, and the problems of women in traditional marriages&rdquo;</span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"> in a collection of her writing, as stated in </span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"><em>American Women Writers. </em></span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;">While some of her works were explicitly feminist, like </span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"><em>The Story of Avis</em></span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"> (1877) and </span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"><em>Doctor Zay</em></span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"> (1882) as noted in Encyclopaedia Britannica,</span><span style="color: #1a1a1a;"> others were more subtle. This subtly can be found in some of Phelps&rsquo;s short stories like &ldquo;The Voices in the Night,&rdquo; </span>originally published in May 1866 in Issue 192 of the <em>New Harper&rsquo;s Monthly Magazine. (</em>For Phelps, a woman writer who was discouraged by society to have her own career, publishing in <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em>, America&rsquo;s most popular periodical, is a feat in itself.)<em> </em>&ldquo;The Voices in the Night&rdquo; follows a woman named Keturah and her surreal experience through two wild sleepless nights, offering lots of bizarre twists to Keturah&rsquo;s seemingly mundane life. Through this farcical piece of work, Phelps also explores the confinements of marriage and Keturah&rsquo;s dreams for excitement in her dull domestic life. When an opportunity for excitement and adventure arises at the end of the story with robbers approaching Keturah&rsquo;s home, her hopes are quelled by her lazy husband.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">We have chosen to republish this story to offer a further glimpse into Phelp&rsquo;s feminist work during a time when women writers were neglected and an insight into the budding ideas of 19th-century feminism. In today&rsquo;s world, where women's rights and freedoms are consistently challenged, taking a step back to look into our past highlights that the feminist fight is far from over.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Editorial Notes</em></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">As the story was originally published in 1866 in New Harper&rsquo;s Monthly Magazine, it is in the public domain. I have transcribed the story from a scan of the original 1866 text sourced from The Internet Archive. In transcribing into a digital platform, I have attempted to preserve as much of the original story as possible, making no correctional edits and keeping in stylistic choices such as italics or dashes. I did, however, change the paragraph formatting from the original two-column text block used in <em>New Harper&rsquo;s Monthly Magazine </em>into a one-column text block, along with extra paragraph spacing, to increase the readability for our audience. Along with the transcription, I have included a glossary for unfamiliar words or phrases and extra notes on some cultural, historical, or biblical references Phelps uses in her work that I deemed important to understanding the story.</p>
