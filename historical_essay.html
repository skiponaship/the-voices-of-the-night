  <p>What led American author Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward to marry a man seventeen years her younger, publish dozens of works criticizing traditional marriage roles, and urge women to light a raging bonfire fueled by corsets?

To answer this question, I began by researching Phelps’s childhood and relationship to her mother. Lynn Abrams explains that in the mid-19th century America, when Phelps was born, that society expected mothers to devote all their efforts to domestic life. Abrams adds that the pressures of caring for children and managing the house left women little time to pursue literature or other academic disciplines. Fortunately, despite the male-nominated nature of 19th century literature, Deidre Johnson notes that Phelps grew up surrounded by women writers. Johnson explains that as one of the first known authors to pen and publish fiction for young girls, Phelps's mother represented the possibility for women to succeed in literature despite the strict societal norms surrounding women in the workforce. I speculate that Phelps’s early exposure to female authors influenced her decision to center women creatives in so many of her own works. Perhaps Phelps took inspiration from her mother when writing Keturah - the protagonist in “The Voices of the Night” - as a woman who dreams of publishing her own works. 
Unfortunately, despite her early success as an author, Phelps’s mother eventually fell victim to the repressive nature of 19th century marriages. As Nina Baym describes, it was difficult for her mother to both maintain a career as an author, “cultivate her own mind and heart”, and manage all the domestic responsibilities of a “housewife.” Later in life, Bayam notes that Phelps’s mother looked back on her adulthood and wrote extensively about the burdens marriage imposed on her artistic ambitions. Keturah’s failure to publish, partially due to the way she was trapped in the mundane routines of managing a household, reflect her mother’s struggles to balance her personal ambitions and domestic expectations.
Perhaps resulting from those burdens, “her mother… suffered from intermittent health issues for much of her adult life” (Johnson). She eventually died of brain fever when Phelps was eight years old (Johnson). In “Chapters from a Life”, Phelps speculated that “the relentless drudgery of domestic toil” contributed to many of her mothers ailments and was ultimately responsible for her early death. Similarly, “The Voices of the Night” explores the health issues married women faced in the Victorian era. Although never explicitly declared a health condition, Keturah experiences severe insomnia that prevents her from sleeping for many consecutive nights. Her condition seems to stem from her dissatisfaction with married life: she’s so bored when awake that she can think of nothing interesting enough to put her to sleep. I conjecture that Phelps took inspiration from her mother’s strained marriage and untimely death when writing about Keturah’s dangerous experience with insomnia.

Many of Phelps’s writings, including “The Voices of the Night” explore the dichotomy between domestic responsibilities and self-realization. Like her mother and many other women of the mid-19th century, Phelps precariously balanced her personal ambitions and passion for writing with what was expected of her as an upper class woman, mother, and wife. According to Lynn Abrams, “motherhood [in the Victorian-era] was confirmation that [a woman] had entered the world of womanly virtue and female fulfillment”. Marriage and motherhood wasn’t only be a social responsibility, but also the ultimate goal of a woman and the only path to personal satisfaction. For women like Phelps, marriage and the social expectations that came with it were a prison. Marriage and motherhood were full professions and barriers to personal satisfaction: wives were expected to run the home, cook, clean, and care for the children, leaving them little time for other pursuits.
Phelps’s work “The Story of Avis” explores the restrictions marriage imposed on personal pursuits by focusing on Avis Dobell's struggles to reconcile her desire for a career as a painter with the societal expectations of women. Throughout the novel, Phelps critiques the patriarchal society of Victorian England and the way it restricted women's opportunities for education, career advancement, and personal autonomy. “The Voices of the Night'' also explores the need for feminist reform in the institution of marriage. I’ll explore this more in my interpretive essay, but due to marital confinement, Keturah can't pursue her dreams of writing and instead lives in endless days of drudgery.

After understanding a bit about Phelps’s childhood and body of work, I decided to look into her adult life. Before diving in, it’s important to understand that Victorian-era social capital depended on wealth and fertility. Lydia Shoup explains that “A man was desirable once he’d acquired wealth, a woman for her ability to bear children”. Because men typically accumulated wealth later in life and women gave birth earlier, younger women would marry older men for the promise of financial stability. These age gaps likely exacerbated the power dynamics that already existed between spouses due to other patriarchal norms of that time. Phelps resisted these pressures: in 1888, she married Herbert Dickinson Ward, a journalist and writer 17 years her younger (Johnson). Beyond their ages, their marriage was unconventional. Johnson explains that they both worked as writers and often collaborated on projects. Phelps’s insistence on marriage being a union of equals bleeds into “The Voices of the Night”. This short story criticizes the “husbands are the protectors of their wives” trope by writing Keturah’s husband to be useless in warding off the burglars and writing Keturah as the one who manages to take action.

Beyond her personal life, the wider social atmosphere of the 19th century influenced Phelps’s works. Literary historian Nsaidzedze explains that 19th century society stereotyped women as demure and submissive; to act outside such stereotypes was to expose oneself to judgment and retribution. He states, “one stereotype image of women [in the Victorian era] was that they were pure and pious”. During this time, women were often depicted as angelic, marking “a shift from the image of the woman portrayed in the medieval period… which… represented a woman as an agent of the devil” (Nsaidzedze). Despite this shift being somewhat positive, expectations surrounding femininity still trapped women in unsustainable and unhealthy roles. 
The perfect Victorian woman was thought to be obedient and subdued; anybody who deviated from these expectations was in danger of being labeled hysterical. Maria Cohut explains that physicians and academics of the 19th century considered hysteria a “disease of the consciousness”. Depression, infertility, and even a love for writing all fell under its symptoms (Cohut). Although both men and women could be diagnosed with hysteria, it was much more prevalent among women, something physicians attributed to their “lazy and irritable nature” (Cohut). In a similar way to men calling women “overreactive” today, Victorian-era men used “women’s hysteria” as an excuse to explain away behaviors that didn’t uphold the status quo and remove non-conformists from the public eye. 
“The Voices of the Night” highlights the repercussions of the “women’s hysteria” epidemic. Keturah thinks it’s necessary that people perceive her as calm and goes to great lengths to convince readers that she’s not delusional or aggressive. This depiction of Keturah reflects how many women - and perhaps Phelps herself - prioritized keeping up appearances and fitting into the status-quo, even to their own detriment.

Victorian-era feminist ideologies also inspired the themes of Phelps’s writing. Herb Hallas explains that just six years before Phelps published “The Voices of the Night”, married women were not permitted legal financial independence in most states, rendering them as ”wage slaves”. Their husbands controlled all of their assets, wages, and savings, leaving women with little agency or autonomy. Hallas notes that these laws remained in place in parts of the country until 1867, a year after the publication “The Voices of the Night”. Similarly, the same year that “The Voices of the Night” was published, the 1866 Women's Suffrage Petition was presented to parliament. Although the petition didn’t succeed in securing women the right to vote, Dr Gillian Murphy states  that it’s often regarded as the formal beginning of the Suffrage Movement. After the petition failed, women began to intentionally organize and unite their efforts surrounding suffrage and women’s rights in the US (Murphy). During this time, Phelps used her writing to advocate for social reform. As we already established, many of her works spoke out against legal and social constraints like financial dependency and disenfranchisement that prevented women from achieving self-determination both within domestic life and within society at large. Additionally, Phelps saw the abolition of corsetry as a social standard as a prerequisite for women’s full participation in general society. Given her history with confining ideas and expectations, her strong stance on corsetry - another object used to confine women - isn’t a surprise.

	Given everything we know about Phelps’s history, the importance of looking at “The Voices of the Night” through a feminist lens is abundantly clear. In “Narratology in the Archive of Literature,” Cohen illustrates the importance of the way we interpret the archives by describing the role that twentieth century feminist reclamations of de Stael and Sand played in uplifting their narratives (page 53). This applies to Phelps as well: we must examine her works in the context of the time, when her ability to publish as a woman was a feat in itself. When resurrecting this story, I considered the nature of female authorship, marriages, and career prospects in the Victorian era. Hopefully, through reading and deconstructing “The Voices of the Night” with me, you too can appreciate the feminist and historical underpinnings of Phelps’s works.
